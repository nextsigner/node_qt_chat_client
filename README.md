# node_qt_chat_client

## Issues for GNU/Linux Users
For running this chat client you need

1. Install nodejs.
2. Install npm packages faye-websocket, qwebchannel and readline.
3. Download from github a portable app [qt_qml_chat_server_amd64.AppImage](https://github.com/nextsigner/qt_qml_chat_server/master/qt_qml_chat_server_amd64.AppImage) created by GitHub user nextsigner.
4. Run $: nodejs node_qt_chat_client.js  

## Note: 
For test this example is necessary download [qt_qml_chat_server](https://github.com/nextsigner/qt_qml_chat_server). Its a project too of example for test QWebChannel.
Remember what this example is running as a client mode and the qt_qml_chat_server running as a server mode.
